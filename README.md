# Internship Project

During my internship at Ignito, I built 20 projects to strengthen my skills in data science, analytics, and machine learning.  
This repository highlights a selection of them, each paired with a short demo video.

## Projects

1. [End-to-End Pipeline](https://github.com/APsheep/Ignito_Intern_Projects/tree/main/Pipeline)  
   - [Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SXzvP1QcFhTZTLYLmy8PM0Svhsh46G0r/view?usp=sharing)  
   -Built a complete data pipeline from raw data ingestion to model deployment, showcasing automation, preprocessing, and evaluation in one workflow.

2. [Digit Recognition](./Recognition)  
   - [Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18gS5aBF7bVFF0cLVuUrIZGf-W9VaVBSa/view?usp=sharing)  
   - Implemented a neural network using the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits, achieving high accuracy on test images. 

3. [Sales Forecasting](./Sales_Forecasting)  
   - [Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TysGt7liM5aEuLQjgHurWaSyhzqgdvfb/view?usp=sharing)  
   - Developed a forecasting model using time series methods and Prophet to predict weekly sales, evaluated with RMSE and MAPE for performance tracking.
   - Changes were made after the recording of the demo video which are reflected in the [README](./Sales_Forecasting/README.md).
